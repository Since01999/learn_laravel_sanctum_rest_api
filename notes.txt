.make a laravel project
.make an api route in routes->api.php
.check the route by putting /api with the base url
.api is a prefix you can change it in app\providers\routeservice provider... you 
can also remove it.

.but if web and api have same routes then only web route will run.so remain the prefix api.


now make controller with --resource and model ,migration and seeder

in the migration write the columms name you want to add in the student

in the seeder use Faker\Factory as Faker 

use it in the seeder to add fake data by using

$faker = Faker::create();

now use foreach with range in it ...the range is for adding the rows in the database


just like this 


public function run()
    {
        $faker = Faker::create();
        foreach(range(0,10) as $value){
           DB::table('students')->insert( [
                'name' => $faker->name(),
                'city' => $faker->city(),
                'fees' => $faker->randomFloat(2)
           ]);
        }
    }


after this php artisan db:seed

now go to controller 
index

return student::all();


after this make route for it ..and call it with the "api" prefix
for getting all data in the apis

similarly add data using the postmen 

first manage the header with  "Accept" and "Application/json"


and validate the data in the controller 

now after validation 

send the data by Student::create($request->All());

and also configure protected $fillable in the Model with all the columns name in an array.


in the postmen..set the header key : accept  and value :application/json


now in order to update the student data... use the update function in the controller by
 passing the id in it 

and update ($request->all()) 

method will be used


similarly defined its route 


and for delete use the delete() as written in the code


now we will make a search api

search api will search city by using the where condition with the student table 


now Protected and Partially Protected API


because we dont want every one to access our API and modify it 

so we will use laravel sanctum which is predefined 
and we only need one thing in the App\http\kernal   .. here we will
uncomment the laravel api code in the API Array.



Now we will go to the api route 


and here we will paste the laravel sanctum Route from the laravel sanctum site.



now comment all the public route and add one route with the sanctum 


and while using it in the postmen ... also define  in header


Key : Accept    Value: application/json


in result you will get this as it looks better


{
    "message": "Unauthenticated."
}

after this make proper registation , login and logout for a protected api
